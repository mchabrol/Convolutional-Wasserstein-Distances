# Wasserstein Barycenter and its Application to Texture Mixing

This project is dedicated to the study of the paper *"Wasserstein Barycenter and its Application to Texture Mixing"*. The objective is to reproduce the results from the paper, analyze its limitations, and propose solutions.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains all the necessary data (images) required to run the code.
- **`experiments/`**: Includes notebooks that replicate results, analyze limitations, and propose solutions. These notebooks are structured as follows:
  - **Notebook 1**: Basic functions from wasserstein distances, wasserstein barycenters and sliced approximations.
  - **Notebook 2**: Decomposition of the texture into wavelet coefficients.
  - **Notebook 3**: Reproduces the results of the paper for first order method and highlights the limitations.
  - **Notebook 4**: Implements potential solutions to address the identified limitations.
  - **Notebook 5**: Summarizes and visualizes the final results.
- **`outputs/`**: Stores the figures generated by running the notebooks.
- **`utils/`**: Contains helper functions used throughout the project.
- **`wasserstein/`**: Includes functions for calculating Wasserstein distances and barycenters, decomposing/recomposing the texture into coefficients etc.
